Greetings!

My name is Chris, and I like JavaScript way more than any reasonable person should.  If I make something that I think is worth sharing, I'll host it here!

This site was built using [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/).  The fonts used are [Oswald](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Oswald), [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans), and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).  I also use [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for my CSS reset, [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) for Javascript utilities, and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) for CSS and HTML pre-processing.
